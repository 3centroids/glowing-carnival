# ctest

Test your C++ program on multiple test cases.

## Usage

1. compile program (bar.cpp) in workspace where ctest resides
2. create folder (bar-tests) and input files (0.in, 1.in, ...) as well as expected output files (0.out, 1.out, ...)
3. ./ctest bar

## Warning

Make sure our program outputs new lines exactly as your output files state.
